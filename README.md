Tea Disease Detection Application

The Tea Disease Detection Application is a web-based solution that leverages deep learning techniques to detect and classify diseases in tea leaves. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained with TensorFlow, the application provides real-time predictions based on uploaded leaf images. This tool helps farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals identify diseases early, thereby improving crop health and productivity.
